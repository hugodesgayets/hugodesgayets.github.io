	<!-- Project infos-->
	<div class="text-block">
		<p>
			Mapstr is a storage and a synchronization service that let users
			save and share their favorite places. Standing at the intersection
			of a commodity tool and a private social network, the app is used
			by over +200 thousands of users and contains millions of places,
			from local POIs to tailor-made locations.
			<br>
			My role as a UX Designer was to help improve user acquisition,
			drive engagement and build-up the community through the design,
			test and delivery of both inclusive and accessible interface solutions.
			<br>
			In this context, I led and mentored a team of 6 engineers, worked
			the end-to-end process â€” from design research to product iterations,
			and provided a rich documentation, including flows, prototypes
			and GUI specifications.
