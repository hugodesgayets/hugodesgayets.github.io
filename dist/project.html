		<h1>Branding</h1>

		<p>
			Mapstr logotype and app icon had gone practically
			unchanged since its creation back in 2015.
			The weird icon, the canary tint plus the lack of typographic
			effort made our branding material feel already outdated.
			It clearly needed a refresh, so I took care of this challenge.
		</p>

		<h2>A clean icon</h2>
		<p>
			The core of our product experience is creating markers on the map.
			Users could fill these markers with colors and icons to build
			their very own map experience. <br>
			As we remain a bookmarking tool, and not a places proposal platform,
			I’ve decided to focus on the marker symbol and get rid of the weird hash icon.
		</p>



		<h2>The logotype</h2>
		<p>
		Alongside with the development of the app icon, I designed a custom sans-serif typeface and technical specifications of the aspects like spacing, color guides and clearance rules.
