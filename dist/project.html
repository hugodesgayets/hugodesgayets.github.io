			Mapstr is a storage and a synchronization service
			that let users save and share their favorite places.
			Standing at the intersection of a commodity tool
			and a private social network, the app is used
			by over +200 thousands of users and contains millions
			of places, from local POIs to tailor-made locations.
			<br>
			My role as a UX Designer was to help improve user acquisition,
			drive engagement and build-up the community through the design,
			test and delivery of both inclusive and accessible
			interface solutions.<br>
			In this context, I led and mentored a team of 6 engineers,
			worked the end-to-end process â€” from design research to product
			iterations, and provided a rich documentation, including flows,
			prototypes and GUI specifications.

			When I started, the app was still close to its initial
			MVP â€” still beta on IOSâ€” So I build a simple UI kit to get going.
			When we released the app on Android I had to improve the framework
			to keep a cohesive experience accross our products. Also,
			as the team scaled, we had to develop a faster and yet a common
			language to work with.

	<h3>Build a platform</h3>
	<p>
		<span>
			Mapstr is aiming to build the default social platform
			to create, collect, and share places everywhere around the world.
			When we introduced user accounts, we knew that we reached
			a milestone â€” enabling users to interact within the app would
			have a huge impact on acquisition, which at that moment,
			was the bottom line lever to our companyâ€™s business growth.
			<br><br>
			I was in charge of the complete UX workflow,
			from the sign-up journey to the design, test and implementation
			of every account related features.<br>
			Each steps of the process required a deep focus on giving users
			the best way to access, control and manage their data â€” Location
			based inputs are a tricky thing, so a privacy by design approach
			was mandatory to create a trustworthy platform.

			The outcomes were surprinsingly good, monthly active users (MAU)
			rised from 3.000 to +60.000 and we continue to receive a lot of great feedbacks.
