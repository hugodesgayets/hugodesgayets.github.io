		<p>I am a Paris based Interaction Designer, with a focus on Information Architecture, Usability, and Prototyping.

I have several years of work experience in start-up environment, which allow me to develop a solid know-how in handling product design life cycle. I am specialized in solving complex problems, through the design and delivery of intuitive experiences, that serves users needs, create trust, and build confidence.

My approach of design combined a high-level product strategy thinking with an excellence in product execution.
I am passionate about User Experience, and clever details that bring uniqueness to the Big Picture.

In a teamwork context my role is flexible, I am mostly bridging the gap between Business development and Engineering. Tasks include identifying userâ€™s need, goals definition, roadmaps, and an ability in managing, from concept to launch.

My skills range from Product thinking, to Visual design and Prototyping.
I previously worked at Ayctor for 4 years, where I directed design projects through a variety of client works.
