        Mapstr lets users saves every places in the world on their own personal map.
<br><br>
is an app that let you save every places in the world
and share your map with your firends.
Rated 5 stars on the Appstore, we raised 700m euros
<br><br>
When I stared, Mapstr was in its early, close to the intial MVP. I was solely in charge of both UI and UX of mapstr.
<br><br>
I worked on X projects Working on both sides was challenging because I had to adapt a very dualistic worklow: Make UX project get UI implement easily and vice versa. I was in a charge of building a team process.
<br><br>

Here the things I’ve learned and put in place as a UX designer:<br>
- User research (data vizualisation / user sessions / reporting)<br>
- Internal tools (emails templates / analytics)<br>
- Documentation (visual styleguide, sitemaps, user flows)<br>
- Prototyping
<br><br>
Unified system of interface guidelines
